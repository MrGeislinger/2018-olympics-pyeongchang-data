# 2018-olympics-pyeongchang-data

Scraped data of the 2018 Winter Olympics Games in Pyeongchang from www.olympic.org.


## Motivation & Introduction

I was looking to explore the 2018 Olympics data but I couldn't find a nice tidy data set readily available. There is a lot of analysis of the winners, but I wanted more to investigate the data of the all the competitors not just the medalists. Surprisingly, I found it difficult to even find the number of competitors. This data would hopefully be presented at some time in the near future, but in the meantime I decided to make my own dataset of those who competed using www.olympic.org.

Efforts have been documented in Jupyter Notebooks and used Python's [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library to scrape the data from www.olympic.org. It is unknown how long the site's data will be preserved in its current form, so CSV files were also created from the data scraped.
